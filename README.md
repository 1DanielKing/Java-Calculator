# Calculator Project

###### Start date: 10/25/2023

Follow OOPs approach. Don't simply write everything in Main class

Make a calculator which will support the following operations:

\+ addition  
\- subtraction  
\* multiplication  
\/ division  
\% modular division

1. ask the user for number 1 input
2. ask the user for the second number input
3. ask the user for an operator ... a single character  
4. return and print that value ...  
5. stretch: print line stating operation performed and its result
6. add a loop at the end "calculate again Y/N?"

**Okay to use Switch Case**

``char ch = nextLine().charAt(0);``  
**USE THIS to convert from String entered to char**
